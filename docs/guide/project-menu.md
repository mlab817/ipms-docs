> Note that this menu varies depending on the user logged in and the current processing status of the project.

## View Project

As the title suggests, the `View Project` menu will take you to the project profile page.

## Update Project

If the project is currently `draft` and the logged in user is the `creator` of the project. This menu item will appear. Clicking on it will take you to the `Update Project` page.

## Transfer Project

Available only to the creator of the project, clicking on the `Transfer Project` menu item will show a dropdown listing all encoders in the system. Here, you can select the user you want to transfer the project to. Doing so, you will lose the ability to access the project.

## Share Project

At times, you will want to share the project profile to users outside the system. The `Share Project` feature allows you to share the project by sending an email to anybody. A link will be sent to the person which they can use to view the project. Alternative, you may [download](#download-project) the project and share the file to the person.

## Delete Project

Available only to the creator of the project, `delete project` menu item will remove the project from the list and into the trash.

> Note that the project will need to be recovered manually from the database. This is subject to improvement later on.

## Download Project

The `download project` menu allows the user to download an MS Word copy of the project. Useful when the user wants to show the project to their head for review.

> This is subject to future workflow for finalizing project.
