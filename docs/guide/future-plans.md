## Automated Prioritization

One of the more important features that the IPD wants to design and implement is automated prioritization. In a nutshell, this means that the system will rank the projects based on the data provided, i.e. project/program profile and the corresponding review.

## Integration with Other Databases/Systems in the DA

By design, the IPMS is ready for interoperability with related systems, e.g. plan and budget preparation, monitoring and evaluation, project identification/evaluation, and project monitoring. In the backend, it uses GraphQL (a technology developed by Facebook) to retrieve data and provide this to the application. This opens other opportunities for integration to other applications (e.g. in-house hosted applications by other offices). It should be noted however, that access will probably be limited to reading data and not updating/writing to the database.

## Support for next PIP Updating

The IPMS is designed after the current PIP Online System of the NEDA. As such, it supports only the data defined in the PIPOL System and corresponds to its data requirements. However, in the future, the period covered is expected to change (from 2017-2022 to 2023-2028). Likewise, the PDP results matrix will also likely change. These things need to be factored in the future.

Since IPMS is developed in-house, it is easy for the IPD to implement it without needing assistance from outside or further financial requirement.
