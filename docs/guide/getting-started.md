## Welcome Screen

When you navigate to the application's URL, you will be shown the welcome screen of the IPMS. At the top-right, there are two buttons to help you navigate: `Getting Started` and `Login`. Clicking on `Getting Started` will take you to the system's documentation and tutorial/help. `Login`, on the other hand, will take you to the login page.

## Creating a new account

To use the application, a user needs to create an account.

1. Go to the Login page by typing `https://da-ipms2020.web.app/login` or by clicking the `Login` button in the welcome screen.

2. Once in the Login page, click on the `Sign up` at the bottom. The screen below should appear.

3. To sign up, just provide your `full name`(this will help admin identify you), your email (any email will do but it has to be valid), your `password` (must be at least 8 characters), and retype the password to confirm. You can use the `visibility icon` to peek at your password.

4. Finally, click on the `Sign Up` button.

The signup process may take a few seconds but if it doesn't complete, something must be wrong. Otherwise, you should see the following screen:

As with other application, while not required, make sure you verify your [email](#verify-email). Instructions are shown below.

## Verifying your email address

Upon creating a new account, you will receive an email from the system asking you to verify your email. Please check your `SPAM` folder as verification email often enters spam folder. The email should look like the picture below:

Just click on the `Verify Email` button. You should see the following screen:

**Verifying your email address ensures strengthened security, allows IPD staff to better assist you if you forget your password, and gives you access to more features on IPMS.**

## Login to your account

Note that as soon as you create an account, you can already login. Email verification ensures you can recover your account in case you forget/lose your password. To login, go to the login page and enter the email and password you used to create your account. Then, click `Login`.

![login_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29625844/83469362-10ba4c00-a4b2-11ea-812d-305e5aa3641c.png)

## Recovering Forgotten Password

If you forget your password, just click on the `Forgot Password` and enter the email you used to create your account. This will send a Password Reset link to your email. Remember to check your `SPAM` folder. Note that you cannot recover your password since this is encrypted. Instead, you will need to reset your password through the link sent to your email. This is why having a verified email is very important. The password reset link is valid for 60 minutes.

Upon clicking the `Reset Password`, you will be prompted to confirm visiting a `Suspicious Link`. You may ignore this warning and click `Confirm.`

You will be taken to the screen where you can create a new password. This is referenced in [#44](https://github.com/mlab817/q-pipol/issues/44#issue-628861813) for improvement.

If you encounter no problems, you will see the following problem. Sometimes, the System will prompt you that the token is invalid. In this case, just send another `Forgot Password` request from the `Login` page.
