# Dashboard

The dashboard provides a snapshot of the activities in the System. It contains summary information on number of projects and number of active notifications. It also contains some shortcut to pages in the System. It also shows the latest activities undertaken by the user. The dashboard is a work-in-progress in that snapshot reports should also be provided to the users as well as System-wide announcements.
