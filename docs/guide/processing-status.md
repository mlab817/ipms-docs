# Processing Status

As projects are processed in the system, their status gets updated. This page aims to explain the meaning of project `processing status`.

|  # | Processing Status | Explanation |
|----|:-----------------:|-------------|
|  1 |Draft              |Draft status is the lowest processing status. This is assigned to newly created projects and will stay so until it is finalized. At this stage, the encoder can `still` update the project.|
|  2 |Finalized          |Projects are `finalized` by finalizing it in the update project page. To finalize a project, the user must have  completed the required information. Finalized projects can no longer be edited.|
|  3 |Endorsed           |Once projects are finalized, they can be endorsed by the head of the operating unit to the IPD for review. Only endorsed projects can be and will be reviewed by IPD.|
|  4 |Returned           |Once endorsed, the assigned IPD reviewer is expected to validate the project by checking the completeness of information provided and if it was duly endorsed by the head of agency. A status `returned` is assigned if any of the two fails.|
|  5 |Validated          |If the two conditions of completeness and endorsement are met, the project will be marked as `validated`.|
|  6 |Reviewed           |Once a project is validated, the IPD reviewer can review the project using the `Review Project` form. Once the review is completed, this will be forwarded to the lead IPD staff for acceptance.|
|  7 |Accepted           |Accepted serves as a validation stage within the IPD. This means that the lead IPD staff accepted the project and the review made by the reviewer.|
|  8 |Approved           |Once the project is accepted, the IPD will present the list of validated projects and their review to the DA management. The DA management then decides to approve/disapprove the project/s.|
|  9 |Encoded            |Once the project has been approved, the IPD reviewer will encode this in the PIPOL System. Once encoded the project will be marked `encoded`.|

The processing status is designed to be sequential. However, depending on actual evaluations made, this could vary across projects.
