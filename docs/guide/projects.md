# Projects

[[toc]]

## View Projects

This shows the list of projects accessible to the users. Note that currently, projects are filtered based on user inputs (projects they own), user affiliation (projects belonging to their office) and user assigned operating units (operating units they can view/review).

![projects](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29625844/83590122-9a881900-a587-11ea-9226-2db2a495c675.png)

The project menu has five options:

1. View - view more details of the project
2. Update - update the details of the project
3. Review - review the project
4. Add - add projects to list for endorsement
5. Delete - delete the project

Rather than hiding options not accessible to users, they are shown as disabled.
